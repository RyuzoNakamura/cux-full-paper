  abstract = {The HERMITS project explores a way to greatly advance the versatility of Robotic Tangible Interfaces. Inspired by hermit crabs, we designed a modular system for table-top, wheeled robots to dock to passive attachment modules, defined as 'mechanical shells'. Different types of mechanical shells can uniquely extend and convert the motion of robots with embedded mechanisms, so that, as a whole architecture, the system can offer a variety of interactive functionality by self-reconfiguration. As for our proof-of-concept system, we have implemented an interactive system based on off-the-shelf robotic toy, toio , with several modifications to enable the active docking capability. We have developed custom-built control architecture to handle the I/O for multiple toio robots using a single computer. A variety of mechanical shells were designed based on four primitive designs, and fabricated with 3D printers. With this system, we introduce a rich application space including physical space organization, digital data physicalization, and entertainment and storytelling systems. The general approach in HERMITS expands how physical interfaces and computers in our daily life can adapt and reconfigure for user interactions with passive attachments. We are in the age where robotic systems are emerging in our living space (e.g. robotic vacuum cleaner, drones). The idea presented in HERMITS has greater implications beyond our prototype, where everyday robotic systems to gain a numerous amount of functionality, expressivity, and interactivity by switching mechanical shells.

There are a growing number of applications for robots that people can engage as capable creatures or as partners rather than tools, yet little is understood about how to best design robots that interact with people in this way. The related field of human-computer interaction (HCI) offers important insights, however autonomous robots are a very different technology from desktop computers. In this paper, we look at the field of HRI from an HCI perspective, pointing out important similarities yet significant differences that may ultimately make HRI a distinct area of inquiry. One outcome of this discussion is that it is important to view the design and evaluation problem from the robot's perspective as well as that of the human. Taken as a whole, this paper provides a framework with which to design and evaluate sociable robots from a HRI perspective.},

  abstract = {Visitors to an English forest were able to explore the woods through the eyes of different animals as part of a virtual reality experience by London design studio Marshmallow Laser Feast. The In the Eyes of the Animal installation was designed for the Abandon Normal Devices Festival in Grizedale Forest. Visitors were given globe-shaped virtual reality headsets decorated in moss and plants to wear. Digital art studio FIELD also designed unusual VR headsets for its Violescence solo exhibition in London. A harness that fitted around the upper body vibrated to emphasise the experience's immersive three-dimensional sound. While wearing the VR helmets, viewers experienced the landscape as if through the eyes of one of three woodland creatures: a dragonfly, a frog and an owl. Visuals created the illusion of soaring over the treetops or wandering the forest floor. Marshmallow Laser Feast used data taken from LiDAR (remote sensing technology), CT scans and aerial drone filming to design the experience. It relies on a real-time system that visualises an artistic interpretation of how trees and plants might appear to the forest's animal inhabitants. "We've always had a hunger for hacking people's senses by combining art and technology," said studio co-founder Barney Steel. "In the Eyes of the Animals gave us chance to use VR as a first person perspective medium -- the ultimate way to hack someone's senses." Virtual reality -- first introduced in the 1990s -- was also used by art collective BeAnotherLab to give people the opportunity to swap genders, while fashion designer Gareth Pugh used the technology to create an experience at London department store Selfridges.

The system was deployed for a month into a shared household. We describe how three people explored and shaped the umwelts of their drones, leading to unique and intimate human-drone couplings. We discuss the compatibility of the umwelt to soma design practice and identify future avenues for research inspired by artificial life and evolutionary robotics. As our contribution, we illustrate how the umwelt as a design metaphor, can open up a generative new design space for human-drone interaction.},

Working from this conceptual framework, a technological notion of Umwelt is developed and applied in analysis of related computer science research and relevant artistic projects. The transdisciplinary approach applied in this investigation aims to frame artistic experimentation with algorithmic mediation of perception in reference to the technoscientific context these practices emerge from.},

Vast numbers of cats are maintained in homes and other facilities each year and are reliant on humans for all of their care. Understanding cat behavior and providing the highest quality environments possible, including positive human-cat interactions, based on research could help improve the outcomes of biomedical research, shelter adoptions, and veterinary care, as well as overall cat welfare. Often, however, cats' needs are inadequately met in homes and some aspects may also not be well met in research colonies and shelters, despite the fact that similar problems are likely to be encountered in all of these environments. This paper provides a brief overview of common welfare challenges associated with indoor housing of domestic cats. Essential considerations for cage confinement are reviewed, along with implications of poor cat coping, such as weakening of the human-animal bond and relinquishment to shelters. The important role that environmental management plays in cat behavior and welfare outcomes is explored along with the need for additional research in key areas.},
